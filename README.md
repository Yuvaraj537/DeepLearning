## 🤖 4. Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of ML using **neural networks**.  

### 🔹 🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
- Basic form of deep learning model.  
- Layers: **Input → Hidden → Output**.  
- ✅ Used for: General classification/prediction tasks.  

### 🔹 🖼️ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Specialized for **image & spatial data**.  
- Uses **convolutional filters** to detect patterns.  
- ✅ Applications: Image recognition, object detection.  

### 🔹 ⏳ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) & LSTM  
- Specialized for **sequence data**.  
- **RNN:** Handles short-term memory but struggles with long dependencies.  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Solves long-term dependency issues.  
- ✅ Applications: Time-series forecasting, speech recognition, text prediction.
